        "OSHA-INSTITUTE was created to give value to children and young people who have the intellect and ability to continue studying but who do not have the economic resources that can lead them to be a successful professional.",
        "At OSHA-INSTITUTE, we are pleased to be involved in the development and training of professionals with specific skills, conditions and talents.",
        "We help each young person or child complete a technical career with us by giving value to the effort and sacrifice that each of them makes to improve their talents or abilities.",
        "This led us to be considered for 2 consecutive years as the best educational support foundation internationally, leaving the name of OSHA-INSTITUTE at the top of the positions, in 2018 and 2019.",
        "Each scholarship donated creates a new professional with the necessary knowledge to be able to function professionally anywhere in the world."
